#### `About`
Santa Lucia App is a full FastAPI service designed to handle backend 
functionality and database integration for a local hardware store named 
Santa Lucia. It provides core payroll and HR features, with a user-friendly 
frontend built using HTML/CSS/JS.
<br/>
The app is containerized using Docker, featuring images for the app itself, 
a PostgreSQL database, and PgAdmin as a GUI for managing database records. 
All containers are orchestrated with Docker Compose.
<br/>
Key features include environment-based configuration via Pydantic, SQLAlchemy 
for ORM, alembic for migrations, FastAPI's built-in async support, 
Gmail integration via app's key, Pandas for data handling, and Excel report 
generation.
